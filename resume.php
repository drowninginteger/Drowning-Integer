				<p>Hi, my name is Sarah, and I'm a WordPress developer who'd like to get into something a little different. After COVID caused me to lose my last job, I decided to start teaching myself React and Node, and enjoyed it more than I thought I would. I've done mostly medium-sized brochure/marketing sites, and I want to start working on more application-style projects, or something similar. My previous work allowed me to build skills in both backend and frontend equally.</p>

				<h3 class="job-heading">WordPress Developer</h3>
				<p class="job-location-time"><span class="job-location">Jordan Crown Design</span>, <span class="job-time-period">Jan. 2013 - Mar. 2020</span></p>

				<div class="job-description">
					<p>At Jordan Crown, we created whole-site redesigns for our clients by creating custom WordPress themes and plugins. As a developer, I took PSDs and Sketch files from the designers and built out the site (backend and frontend) using PHP, Javascript, HTML, and SASS/CSS.</p>

					<p>I usually reported to my project manager and the designer, but I frequently communicated with clients directly to collect project requirements and discuss potential changes, updates, additions, and bug fixes.</p>

					<p>My position involved not only translating design documents into web pages, but also working with clients to come up with creative solutions to their problems, whether they were updating public-facing web site elements, or improving site administration usability. I took pride in doing everything I could to make things easy to use and visually pleasing.</p>

					<p>In addition to building web sites, about 4 years of my time at Jordan Crown also involved occasionally building HTML emails for a marketing client of ours. I took design assets from the client and created HTML newsletters that I later sent out through their Hubspot account at the requested times.</p>

					<p>Many projects I worked on also required me to manage web servers, usually CentOS or Ubuntu systems, but a few Windows servers as well. I set up Apache virtual hosts, MySQL databases, and DNS, and did some light Bash scripting to automate some more menial processes.</p>

					<p>Project source control was done with Git.</p>

				<p><span class="label">HTML and CSS/SASS:</span> I've been building well-structured, mobile-friendly layouts for almost a decade, and using SASS for about half of that.</p>
				<p><span class="label">WordPress:</span> I have 7 years of experience building custom WordPress themes and plugins.</p>
				<p><span class="label">PHP:</span> My 7 years of WordPress development involved both frontend and backend, which taught me a lot about using PHP.</p>
